I have a particular focus on spatial computing and FPGAs for compute intensive workloads at the Edge, as well exploring the RISC-V architecture including soft/hard processors and SoC for hardware acceleration. I work together with my supervisor [Prof. Paris Kitsos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ByA11KQAAAAJ). 

My research experience also entails embedded systems and internet of things with multi-modal sensor technologies.

In the past, I have delved into wireless sensor networks and voice coding algorithms' evaluation in mobile computing [MSc Thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334657073_VoIP_Wireless_Application_Development_for_the_Android_Mobile_Platform_using_the_SIP_protocol). 

As a radio amateur (SV2HZK) hobbyist I have a keen interest in satellite communication and weather data. Recently, I have built a [weather satellite image receiver](https://x.com/Stavros_IT/status/1689020671400067072?s=20) based on Raspberry Pi and an open- source project [raspberry-noaa-v2](https://github.com/jekhokie/raspberry-noaa-v2). Furthermore, I also process earth observation data from [EUMETSAT](https://x.com/Stavros_IT/status/1745944607106486683?s=20).
